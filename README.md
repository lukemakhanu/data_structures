# Data structures

# Heaps

left child = parent index * 2 + 1
right child = parent index * 2 + 2

Things to know : Insert, HeapifyUp, HeapifyDown, Extract
MaxHeap : root node is always biggest, MinHeap : root node is always smallest

# Singly linked list
This to consider, to delete you have to skip the node you want to be deleted

# Hashtable

Thing to consider is collision handling. There are two ways to handle that, open addressing and separate chaining.In this case i use separate chaining which is basically an array and a linked list

# Todo

1. Add unit test
